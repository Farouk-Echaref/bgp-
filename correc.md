# overview:

- GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator-3) is an advanced network simulation tool that allows users to emulate real network hardware and software. It supports real Cisco IOS images, virtual machines, Docker containers, and third-party network devices. GNS3 is often used by network professionals for realistic lab environments and certification training (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE).

Packet Tracer is a simpler, educational network simulator developed by Cisco. It uses simulated network devices instead of real IOS images, making it lightweight and ideal for basic networking concepts and CCNA-level learning.

GNS3 is realistic but complex, while Packet Tracer is easier but limited.

- bgp is the routing protocol of the internet, it links between different ASes, It is an exterior gateway protocol (EGP) used to exchange routing information between ISPs, enterprises, and data centers.

BGP routers establish peer connections (neighbors) using TCP (port 179).

They exchange routing updates based on prefixes and AS numbers.

BGP selects the best path using attributes like AS-Path, Local Preference, and MED.

It ensures loop prevention through the AS-Path attribute

- layer 2: data link layer:
communication within the same lan. 
uses mac addresses to identify devices.
switches and bridges operate at layer 2
supports ethernets and vlans

layer3: handles routing between different network.
use IP address for devices identification
routers operate at layer 3
supports IP, OSPF, BGP, ICMP (ping)

# part1: 
**FRR (Free Range Routing)** is an open-source routing software supporting **BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, RIP, and more**. It runs on **Linux, BSD, and containers**, integrating with the **Linux kernel** for dynamic routing. FRR is widely used in **ISPs, data centers, and cloud networks** due to its **flexibility, multi-protocol support, and SDN compatibility**.

Sure! Here's a brief explanation of each:

### 1. **LAN (Local Area Network):**
   - **Definition:** A LAN is a network that connects devices within a limited geographic area, like a home, office, or campus. It allows devices to communicate directly with each other, typically over Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
   - **Issues it solves:** LANs provide fast, low-latency communication and centralized resource sharing (e.g., files, printers). It is typically limited by physical distance and network complexity.

### 2. **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):**
   - **Definition:** A VLAN is a logical segmentation of a LAN that allows multiple broadcast domains on the same physical network. Devices in different VLANs can be grouped together even if they are on separate physical locations.
   - **Issues it solves:** VLANs improve network performance, security, and manageability by isolating traffic between different groups (e.g., isolating departments in an organization). They also help reduce broadcast traffic and limit the impact of network failures.

### 3. **VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN):**
   - **Definition:** VXLAN is an encapsulation technique used to create virtual networks over Layer 3 (IP) networks. It is often used to extend VLANs across multiple data centers or cloud environments, making it possible to scale large, distributed networks.
   - **Issues it solves:** VXLAN is used to overcome the limitations of VLANs, especially the 4096 VLAN ID limit. It enables network scalability, multi-tenancy, and seamless extension of Layer 2 networks over Layer 3 infrastructure (e.g., between data centers or across cloud environments).

In short:
- **LAN** connects devices within a single location.
- **VLAN** segments a LAN logically for better security and traffic management.
- **VXLAN** extends VLANs over long distances, providing scalability and flexibility.
