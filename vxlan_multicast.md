## **1. What is Multicast in VXLAN?**  
Multicast is a method of **distributing network packets to multiple destinations** efficiently. In VXLAN, **multicast is used to replicate broadcast and unknown unicast traffic across VTEPs (VXLAN Tunnel Endpoints)** in the same VXLAN segment (VNI).  

Since VXLAN **extends Layer 2 over Layer 3**, normal **broadcasts and unknown unicasts** (which are common in VLANs) cannot naturally function in an IP-based network. To solve this, VXLAN uses **multicast** to ensure that frames are delivered to all the VTEPs that belong to the same VXLAN segment (VNI).

## **2. Static Multicast vs. Dynamic Multicast in VXLAN**  

| Feature            | Static Multicast       | Dynamic Multicast |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| **Configuration**  | Manually assigned multicast groups | Uses **PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)** to dynamically discover VTEPs |
| **Scalability**    | Harder to scale (manual setup for each VXLAN segment) | Scales better (automatically adjusts to network changes) |
| **Flexibility**    | Fixed multicast groups | Dynamically adapts as VTEPs join/leave |
| **Efficiency**     | Less efficient (traffic sent even if no VTEPs are present) | More efficient (traffic sent only to active VTEPs) |
| **Usage**         | Small networks, test environments | Large-scale deployments (data centers, cloud networks) |

## **3. Static Multicast in VXLAN**  
In **static multicast**, each VXLAN segment (VNI) is manually assigned to a **predefined multicast group**. Every VTEP in that VXLAN listens to the multicast group and forwards traffic accordingly.  

### **How Static Multicast Works**  
- The **administrator manually assigns a multicast group** (e.g., **239.1.1.1**) to each VXLAN segment (VNI).  
- When a VTEP needs to forward **broadcast, unknown unicast, or multicast (BUM) traffic**, it **sends it to the assigned multicast group**.  
- All **other VTEPs** that have the same VNI **receive and process the traffic**.  

### **Example Configuration (Cisco Nexus VXLAN)**  
```
vlan 10
  vn-segment 10010
  multicast-group 239.1.1.1
```
In this case:  
- VLAN 10 maps to **VNI 10010**.  
- **Multicast group 239.1.1.1** is assigned to handle BUM traffic for this VXLAN.  
- Every VTEP that has VNI 10010 will listen to **239.1.1.1** and process the traffic.  

### **Limitations of Static Multicast**  
‚ùå **Requires manual configuration** of multicast groups for each VXLAN segment.  
‚ùå If a VTEP **doesn‚Äôt exist**, the multicast traffic is still sent, wasting bandwidth.  
‚ùå **Not scalable** for large networks with thousands of VNIs.

## **4. Dynamic Multicast in VXLAN (Using PIM and IGMP Snooping)**  
In **dynamic multicast**, VTEPs **automatically discover which VTEPs need multicast traffic** using **PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)** and **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)**. This makes multicast more **efficient and scalable**.  

### **How Dynamic Multicast Works**  
- The **network dynamically determines which VTEPs** need to receive multicast traffic.  
- **PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast)** builds a **multicast distribution tree**, ensuring traffic is only forwarded when needed.  
- **IGMP snooping** helps switches **learn which hosts** are interested in a multicast group.  

### **Multicast Groups in Dynamic Multicast**  
- Instead of assigning multicast groups **manually**, VTEPs **join and leave multicast groups dynamically** based on IGMP.  
- This means multicast traffic is **only sent to VTEPs that actually need it**, reducing bandwidth usage.  

### **Example of Dynamic Multicast Using PIM**  
1. **PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is enabled** on the network.  
2. When a **VTEP needs to send BUM traffic**, it **sends an IGMP Join message** to join a multicast group.  
3. The network **dynamically builds a multicast forwarding tree** so that only necessary VTEPs receive the traffic.  

### **Why is Dynamic Multicast Better?**  
‚úÖ **Traffic is sent only when needed** ‚Üí Saves bandwidth.  
‚úÖ **Automatically adapts** when VTEPs join/leave.  
‚úÖ **Scales better** than static multicast for **large VXLAN deployments**.

## **5. Summary: Which One to Use?**  
- **Use Static Multicast** if:  
  - You have a **small, simple VXLAN setup**.  
  - You don‚Äôt mind **manually configuring multicast groups**.  
  - Your network doesn‚Äôt support **PIM or IGMP snooping**.  

- **Use Dynamic Multicast** if:  
  - You need **scalability** for a **large network or data center**.  
  - You want **efficient bandwidth usage**.  
  - Your network supports **PIM and IGMP snooping**.

### **Final Thoughts**  
VXLAN **relies on multicast** for handling **Layer 2 broadcast traffic over Layer 3 networks**. Whether you use **static or dynamic multicast** depends on **network size and efficiency needs**.
