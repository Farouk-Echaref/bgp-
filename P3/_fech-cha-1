# Disable IPv6 forwarding (not required for this setup)
# best practice for security and performance reasons
# some services (e.g., systemd, kernel) might still generate IPv6 packets, and that adds load cs they will still be routed
# If an attacker sends IPv6 packets (like rogue Router Advertisements), your router could accidentally forward them, creating a security risk.

 # Define iBGP peer group for dynamic neighbors
 # Peer groups allow you to configure multiple neighbors with the same settings, reducing configuration repetition.
 # Instead of defining each neighbor separately, a peer group applies the same configuration to all iBGP neighbors.
 neighbor ibgp peer-group

 # In iBGP, all peers must be in the same AS (unlike eBGP, where peers have different AS numbers)
 neighbor ibgp remote-as 1  # Since this is iBGP, all routers have the same AS

 # why2: https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/question/0D53i00000qgWsZCAU/update-source-loopback
 # Loopback interfaces never go down, unlike physical interfaces.
 # If a physical link fails, the router can still reach the loopback via another path (as long as OSPF is running).
 # Ensures BGP sessions remain stable even if an interface goes down.
 # Without this command, BGP would use the physical interface (e.g., eth0 or vxlan10), which could go down!
 neighbor ibgp update-source lo  # Use loopback interface for stability

 # Listen for dynamic BGP neighbors from leaf routers in the specified range
 # Automatically discovers new BGP neighbors in 1.1.1.0/29 using bgp listen range
 # Any router with an IP in 1.1.1.0/29 that tries to establish BGP will automatically become a neighbor.
 # These neighbors are automatically assigned to the ibgp peer group.
 # Why use bgp listen range?
 # Instead of manually configuring each neighbor (neighbor 1.1.1.2 remote-as 1, etc.), this automatically detects neighbors in the given subnet.
 # Useful in dynamic setups where new routers might be added.

# This enables EVPN as a BGP address family.
# EVPN (Ethernet VPN) is used in VXLAN networks for:
# Layer 2 extension over an IP network (bridging VLANs across data centers).
# Layer 3 forwarding (routing between VXLAN segments).
# MAC and IP mobility (handling dynamic changes in endpoint locations).

 # This activates EVPN for the ibgp peer group.
 # BGP will now exchange EVPN routes with iBGP neighbors.
 # Why activate EVPN for iBGP?

 # VXLAN needs a control plane to learn MAC addresses and routes dynamically.
 # Instead of relying on flood-and-learn (like traditional VXLAN), BGP EVPN distributes MAC/IP information efficiently

 # resource frr: https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/bgp.html#route-reflector
 # In iBGP, routers normally don't forward routes learned from one iBGP peer to another (to prevent loops).
 # A route reflector allows iBGP routers to share routes, avoiding the need for a full mesh. 
 # Without this, every leaf router would have to be manually connected to every other router
