# BGP-AS Project Guide

![alt text](Autonomous-Systems-connected-by-BGP.jpeg)

## Overview
This project focuses on **network simulation and configuration** using **BGP EVPN, VXLAN, GNS3, and Docker**. You will work with routing protocols like **BGP (MP-BGP), OSPF, and IS-IS**, simulating a virtualized data center network.

## Dynamic Routing:

Dynamic routing, sometimes called adaptive routing, is more complex than static routing because it creates more possible routes to send packets across a network. Dynamic routes are typically used in larger, fluid networks where static routes would be cumbersome to maintain and frequently reconfigure. Because dynamic routing is more complicated, it consumes more bandwidth than static routing.

Dynamic routing uses algorithms to compute multiple possible routes and determine the best path for traffic to travel through the network. It uses two types of complex algorithms: distance vector protocols and link state protocols.

Both distance vector and link state protocols create a routing table within the router that includes an entry for each possible destination of a network, group of networks or specific subnet. Each entry specifies which network connection to use to send out a received packet.

## Dynamic Routing Protocols
### What is ISIS (the protocol not the state)?

#### **Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Routing Protocol**  

IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) is a **link-state interior gateway protocol (IGP)** used for routing within a single administrative domain, such as an ISP or enterprise network. It is similar to OSPF, as both use **Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm** to determine the best paths.  

##### **Key Features**  
- **Originally designed for OSI networks** by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), later adapted for IP as **Integrated IS-IS**.  
- **Hierarchical design** with two levels:  
  - **Level-1 (L1)** â€“ Intra-area routing.  
  - **Level-2 (L2)** â€“ Inter-area (backbone) routing.  
  - **L1/L2 routers** bridge areas.  
- **Operates at Layer 2**, avoiding IP-based transport and making it more secure than OSPF.  
- **Terminology differences from OSPF**:  
  - **Router** = **Intermediate System (IS)**  
  - **Host** = **End System (ES)**  
  - **Router ID** = **Network Entity Title (NET)** (NSAP format).  
- **Highly scalable**, making it the preferred choice for **large service provider networks**.  

IS-IS remains a **robust and efficient alternative to OSPF**, especially for **large-scale deployments** where scalability and protocol efficiency are critical.

### What is OSPF?

![OSPF in simple terms](OSPF_simplified.jpg)

![BGP with OSPF Simplified](bgp-simplified.svg)

#### **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)** 

- OSPF, short for Open Shortest Path First, is a dynamic routing protocol commonly used in large-scale IP networks. It functions by determining the shortest path to route data packets between routers. OSPF calculates this path based on various metrics such as link bandwidth, delay, and cost.
At its heart, OSPF is a routing protocol built for the Internet Protocol (IP) networks. It operates within an Autonomous System (AS) â€” a collection of IP networks and routers under the control of one entity that presents a common routing policy to the Internet.

### What is BGP?
#### **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** â€“ A Path Vector Routing Protocol

#### **Autonomous System (AS)**
- An **Autonomous System (AS)** is a group of networks and gateways managed by a single administrative authority.
- Gateways within the same AS are called **interior neighbors**, while those in different ASes are **exterior neighbors**.
- Each AS has a **routing policy** that dictates how it announces and receives route advertisements.
- ASes announce their routing policies using **BGP**, which is crucial for routing packets across the internet.

ðŸ“– **Reference:** [Cloudflare - What is an Autonomous System?](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/)

#### **Static vs. Dynamic Routing**
- **Static Routing**: Configured manually, does not change unless modified by an administrator.
- **Dynamic Routing (BGP)**: Used by **ISPs and data centers**, dynamically updates routes based on changes in the network.

#### **RFC Definition of BGP**
> "The primary function of a BGP-speaking system is to exchange network reachability information with other BGP systems. This includes the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that routing information traverses, allowing the construction of an AS connectivity graph for reachability and policy enforcement."

#### **Cloudflare's Explanation of BGP**
- **BGP enables the internet** by allowing ASes to announce the IP addresses they manage and their connectivity to other ASes.
- BGP routers **update routing tables dynamically** to ensure efficient packet delivery.
- Changes in AS routing policies affect global internet routing.

-A network bridge is a device that operates at the Link Layer and passes traffic across networks based on MAC addresses. As a result, a network bridge is also known as a device that operates at the Layer 2 level. It constructs tables of MAC addresses, using the information it gathers about what hosts are connected to each network, and bases its judgments about which packets to forward on those tables. A Linux host computer may make use of a hardware bridge in order to simulate the functionality of a software bridge.
